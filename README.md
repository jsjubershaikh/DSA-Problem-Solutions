# DSA-Problem-Solutions
# Daily DSA Practice

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Practice** repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through consistent problem-solving. Each day, I aim to solve at least one DSA problem and document my solutions here.

## Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts.
- Build a habit of daily coding practice.
- Create a personal reference for future problem-solving.
- Contribute to the coding community by sharing solutions.

## Problem Solving Approach

For each problem, I will follow a structured approach:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Carefully read the problem statement and identify the requirements.
2. **Plan the Solution**: Outline the steps needed to solve the problem. Consider edge cases and constraints.
3. **Implementation**: Write clean and efficient code to implement the solution.
4. **Testing**: Test the solution with various input cases to ensure its correctness.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

## Problem Categories

This repository covers a variety of topics, including but not limited to:
- **Arrays**: Manipulation and searching algorithms.
- **Strings**: Pattern matching and manipulation techniques.
- **Linked Lists**: Operations like reversal, merging, and cycle detection.
- **Trees**: Traversal methods and binary tree operations.
- **Graphs**: Search algorithms like BFS and DFS.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizing problems using memoization and tabulation.
- **Backtracking**: Solving problems with constraint satisfaction.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Implementing classic algorithms and understanding their complexities.
